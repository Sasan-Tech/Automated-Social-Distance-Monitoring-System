# Background
<!-- taken from introduction in the report, 1 - 2 lines only -->
<!-- show the result -->
<!-- tell them that the demo video is avaiable to guide them on how to use the GUI -->

# Folder Management
<!-- Directory Tree for google drive -->
<!-- tell that Folder Management for GUI and python can follow the ones that have been provided in this Repository -->


# Prior preparation
<!-- Install Anaconda, Python, prepare enough space for Drive, Colab -->

 
# Steps
<!-- Download the model that they want to use, https://github.com/tensorflow/models/blob/master/research/object_detection/g3doc/tf1_detection_zoo.md -->
<!-- Make all the required folders in drive -->
<!-- Run the colab with appropriate command, ask them to follow the commands that have been provided in colab -->
<!-- Download the exported model from their drive into their own local directory (in the exported folder?) -->
<!-- Run the main.py -->
