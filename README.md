**Project**: Design and implementation of a simple machine learning system that could automatically detect persons and analyze the social distance between them.

**Modules involved**: Machine learning, Deep Learning, Person detection

# Background
<!-- taken from introduction in the report, 1 - 2 lines only -->
<!-- show the result -->
<!-- tell them that the demo video is avaiable to guide them on how to use the GUI -->

# Folder Management
In order to train the models, we will need to set the Google Drive directory to store the data that we need to use in order to do the training. The path that we used in the colab file can be changed accordingly, but the path that we included here is the recommendation that we have used for our project. Please take note that all folders will be placed inside of the **SocialDistancing** folder in the root folder of Google Drive.

The folders above are specially created for Google Drive to trained and export the model. In order to run the GUI, we will need to follow the pattern of the directory that we have used for this project since we will work with python file from now onwards. You can easily pull the repository to see the arrangement of the folders in a better view.

# Prior preparation
Before we can start to train the model and run the program, we may need to prepare several things as stated below:
<ul>
 <li>Anaconda</li>
 <li>Python</li>
 <li>Tensorflow v1</li>
 <li>Required library, such as Matplotlib, CV2, PyQt5</li>
 <li>Google account</li>
 <li>Google Drive with at least 7.5GB free space</li>
 <li>Google Colaboratory</li>
</ul>

# Steps
<!-- Download the model that they want to use, https://github.com/tensorflow/models/blob/master/research/object_detection/g3doc/tf1_detection_zoo.md -->
<!-- Make all the required folders in drive -->
<!-- Run the colab with appropriate command, ask them to follow the commands that have been provided in colab -->
<!-- Download the exported model from their drive into their own local directory (in the exported folder?) -->
<!-- Run the main.py -->
